## History

My first personal portfolio webiste was created in 2019 and hosted on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance. A simple Nginx static HTML page. Eventually, I wanted to upgrade from my simple page which was just links to a more comprehensive site which defines me better. I created a new design which was still very far from perfect, and integrated with a go backend to dynamically load the data for the site from a MongoDB server. This is the current versions: V3. 

## Implementation Decisions

The biggest changes going into the 3rd version were Next.js and moving away from AWS to host on Vercel. 

The backend uses a Supabase PostgreSQL database, which at the time of writing primarily includes data related to my Chatbot component.
