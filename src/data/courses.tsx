      "title": "Introduction to Computer Systems",
      "description": "This course is primarily a course on computer systems and low-level programming. We will discuss the relationship between the computer architecture (the hardware) and the applications that run on it (the software), and the issues that influence the design of both. Programs will be written in both C and x86-64 assembly. We will explore how instructions are encoded and executed and how binary data types are encoded and interpreted by computer hardware, and how these issues relate to the performance and reliability of our applications.",
