    "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am a Computer Science & Molecular Biology student and aspiring Full-Stack Developer.",
    "Computer Science has always been a passion of mine, and I frequently enjoy working on my own personal projects in my free time.  I discovered my avid interest in molecular biology while studying at Simon Fraser University, and one day I dream of using my skills to work in the field of biotechnology.  I am particularly interested in the comparisons that can be drawn between cellular machinery and computer systems, and how they influence each other.",
    "Over the last 3 years, I have invested over a thousand hours into enhancing the SFU campus experience as part of my roles as President of the Science Undergraduate Society and Applied Science Representative for the Simon Fraser Student Society.",
    "I am an avid traveller and at age 19, I flew to Europe solo and backpacked through more than 15 countries over the next 3 months."
