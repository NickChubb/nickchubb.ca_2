    "ðŸ‘‹Â Hi! My name is Nick Chubb and I am a computer science and molecular biology & biochemistry student in my final year of studies at Simon Fraser University. Over the last several years, I have worked both full and part-time in the software industry which has helped me develop strong front-end coding skills, primarily in React, Next.js, HTML, and CSS.",
    "Computer Science has always been a passion of mine, and I frequently enjoy working on my own personal projects in my free time. I discovered my avid interest in molecular biology while studying at Simon Fraser University, and one day I dream of using my skills to work in the field of biotechnology. As a student of both computer science and molecular biology, I have developed a unique perspective on the intersection of technology and the natural world.",
    "Beyond my studies, I have been deeply involved in student politics as an executive member of several different student unions, including President of the Science Undergradute Society and Applied Science Representative for the Simon Fraser Student Society. These experiences have allowed me to develop strong leadership and communication skills, which I believe will serve me well in my future career as a software engineer.",
    "In my free time I enjoy reading, going to the gym, or spending time with friends and family. I am an avid traveller and at age 19, I flew to Europe solo and backpacked through more than 15 countries over the next 3 months."
