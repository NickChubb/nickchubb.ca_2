  'ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Nick and I am a new graduate from Simon Fraser University with a Joint Major in Computer Science and Molecular Biology. Over the last several years, I have worked both full and part-time in the software industry which has helped me develop strong coding skills, primarily in TypeScript, React, Next.js, Java, HTML, and CSS.',
  'In my free time, I frequently engage myself in personal projects to practice and refine my software development skills. I consider myself a lifelong learner and I am always excited at the opportunity to learn new languages or frameworks. ',
  'I discovered my avid interest in molecular biology while studying at Simon Fraser University. As a student of both computer science and molecular biology, I have developed a unique perspective on the intersection of technology and the natural world.',
  'Beyond my studies, I have been deeply involved in student politics as an executive member of several different student unions, including President of the Science Undergradute Society and Applied Science Representative for the Simon Fraser Student Society. These experiences have allowed me to develop strong leadership and communication skills, which I believe will serve me well in my future career as a software engineer.',
  'In my free time I enjoy reading, going to the gym, or spending time with friends and family. I am an avid traveller and have now completed over 6 months collectively of solo backpacking throughout Europe and Asia.',
