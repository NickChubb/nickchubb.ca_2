A source of great de-motivation comes to me every year around this time.  It comes when I begin to look ahead to the upcoming year, and behind at the year I had.  Often, it is easiest at first to see the plans and dreams I had made that did not come to fruition.  I must remind myself to, instead, look at it from another perspective: to consider just how much progress I have made over the last 12 months.  Just looking at the things I do every day, whether for work or my personal life, I would be completely unable to do a year ago.  In life, so much change happens so fast that sometimes I need to take a look back for a reminder of how far I have come, instead of concerning myself so much with the uncertainties of the future.
